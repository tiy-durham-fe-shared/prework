# Front-End prework for TIY Durham

Prework for the Iron Yard Durham's front end class. 

## Goals

- Get your Mac ready to go
- Learn as much CSS, HTML and JavaScript as you can *before class starts*
- Fill out the [prework survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d0O5frSJy7L-e6bdz5y3ZDmcSj8u-GK0x_UkaqsMqfs/viewform?usp=send_form) *before class starts*

The more you do, the more you'll get out of the cohort. *Students who skimp on prework will find themselves
struggling* throughout the cohort, so don't do that!

## Set up your Mac

1. [Install vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime (not free)](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
2. [Install Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
3. [Install Node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
4. [Install Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
5. [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
6. [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Learn the front-end languages

Come up with a schedule for yourself-- maybe 30 minutes/an hour per day-- to
spend reading about and tinkering with the following.

### HTML and CSS

- [Find web sites/designs](https://dribbble.com/) that [you like](http://squarespace.com/templates/) and try building them yourself
- [Learn HTML and CSS basics](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
- [Play with HTML/CSS in Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
- [Treehouse has a 14 day free trial](https://teamtreehouse.com/) take their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses, and
pay them if you think they earned it!

### JavaScript

## Learn tools

We use a number of tools in class. If class is the first time you experience them, you'll have a headache in 
week 1, I guarantee it. So, check em out beforehand.

### Terminal

You will be using the Terminal. A *lot*. So, do yourself a favor and learn
about it before the cohort starts!

- [Read this](http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/)
- [Take this course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations) note,
Team Treehouse is not free, but it does have a 14 day free trial, so take
advantage of that!
- [And read this](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-li...).

### Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system. It allows you to make changes to files, track
file history, coordinate your changes with those being made by your teammates,
etc. We'll be using this heavily, so the more you know, the better!

- [Treehouse git basics course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)
- [Gitting started...](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
- [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/)
  - Hello World
  - Getting Your Project on GitHub
  - Understanding the GitHub flow
  - Forking Projects
  - Mastering Markdown
- [Try git exercises](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

## Fill out this survey

Fill out the [prework survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d0O5frSJy7L-e6bdz5y3ZDmcSj8u-GK0x_UkaqsMqfs/viewform?usp=send_form)
no later than *1 week before class*.

### More reading/resources

You can read a whole lot more about HTML over at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories).
That link brings you to a comprehensive list of HTML elements, grouped by
category.

If you want to play with HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, you may want to use one of
these handy tools:

- http://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output
- http://codepen.io/pen/
